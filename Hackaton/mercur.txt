Mercury \n Mercury is the first terrestrial planet from the Sun and the smallest in our Solar System. \n Its surface is heavily cratered, due to the countless impacts it has received. It has a mass of 3,28 x 10^23kg (5.5% of Earth’s mass). Mercury consists of approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material. Mercury's orbit is inclined by 7 degrees to the plane of Earth's orbit. \n Thanks to its high density, a robust 5.427 g/cm^3, which is just slightly lower than Earth's 5.514 g/cm^3 – Mercury has a surface gravity of 3.7 m/s^2. \n Atmosphere composition: 42% molecular oxygen, 29.0% sodium, 22.0% hydrogen, 6.0% helium, 0.5% potassium. The atmosphere also shows traces of argon, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, steam vapors, xenon, krypton and neon \n Mythology \n The Greek god Hermes (the Roman Mercury ) was the god of translators and interpreters. He was the most clever of the Olympian gods, and served as messenger for all the other gods. He ruled over wealth, good fortune, commerce, fertility, and thievery. Among his personal favorite commercial activities was the corn trade. He was also the god of manual arts and eloquence. As the deity of athletes, he protected gymnasiums and stadiums. As one of the "planets" known in antiquity, Mercury's name is at the origin of the name of "Wednesday" in French and other Romance languages: "mercredi" comes from the Latin "Mercurii dies", or "Mercury's day".
