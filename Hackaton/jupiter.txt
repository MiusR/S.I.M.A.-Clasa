Jupiter \n Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. \n It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one thousandth of the mass of the Sun. \n Jupiter was the first planet to form, and its inward migration during the primordial Solar System impacted much of the formation history of the other planets. \n Its chemical composition is primarily hydrogen and helium. \n By mass, Jupiter's atmosphere is approximately 76% hydrogen and 24% helium, though, because helium atoms are more massive than hydrogen molecules, Jupiter's upper atmosphere is about 90% hydrogen and 10% helium by volume. \n Jupiter's mass is 318 times that of Earth. \n It has a gravitational force of 24,79 m\s^2. \n Atmosphere composition: 89.8% hydrogen (H2), 10.2 % helium, ~ 0.3% methane, ~ 0.026% ammonia, ~0.003% deuterated hydrogen (HD), 0.0006% ethane, 0.0004% water. \n Mythology \n Jupiter (Latin: Iuppiter,from Proto Italic *djous "day, sky" + *pater "father", thus "sky father", also known as Jove, is the god of the sky and thunder, and the king of the gods in ancient Roman religion and mythology. Jupiter was the chief deity of the Roman state religion throughout the Republican and Imperial eras, until Christianity became the dominant religion of the Empire. In Roman mythology, Jupiter comes into direct contact with with Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, to establish principles of the Roman religion such as offering, or sacrifice.
