Venus \n Venus is the second planet from the sun and also the closest in mass and size to its neighbour Earth. \n It is known for having the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, being composed mostly out of carbon dioxide, alongside a thick sulfuric acid cloud over. \n Venus has a diameter of 12,103.6 km, making it the third smallest planet in our Solar System. \n The surface pressure is 9.3 megapascals and the average surface temperature is 737 Kelvin. \n With a mean radius of 4.6023x10^8 km^2, a mass of 4.8675x10^24 kg, and a density of 5.243 g\cm^3. Venus is equivalent in size to 0.9499 Earths, 0.815 times as massive, and is roughly 0.95 times as dense. Hence, it is no surprise because the gravity on Venus is very close to that of Earth's 8.87 m\s^2. \n Atmospheric composition: ~ 96.5% carbon dioxide, ~ 3.5% nitrogen, 0.015% sulfur dioxide, 0.007% argon, 0.002% water vapor, 0.0017% carbon monoxide, 0.0012% helium, 0.0007% neon. \n Mythology \n Venus is a Roman goddess, whose functions encompass love, beauty, desire, sex, fertility, prosperity, and victory. In Roman mythology, she was the ancestor of the Roman people through her son, Aeneas, who survived the fall of Troy and fled to Italy. Julius Caesar claimed her as his ancestor.
