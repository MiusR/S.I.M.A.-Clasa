Neptune \n Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant major planet orbiting our Sun. More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is not visible to the naked eye.  \n Neptune is about four times wider than Earth. \n Neptune takes 165 Earth years to go around the Sun. \n It is the densest of the ice giants. \n Neptune has four rings and four more ring arcs. \n Neptune has 16 known moons. \n The planet's rich blue color comes from methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red wavelengths of light, but allows blue ones to be reflected into space. \n Its gravity at 1 bar is 11.15 m\s^2, 1.14 times the surface gravity of Earth, and surpassed only by Jupiter. Neptune's equatorial radius of 24,764 km (about 15387.64 mi) is nearly four times that of Earth. \n Atmosphere composition: 80% hydrogen (H2), 19% helium, 1.5% methane, ~ 0.019%  deuterated hydrogen (HD), ~ 0.00015% ethane. Ice: ammonia, water, (NH4SH), methane. \n Mythology \n Neptune (Latin: Neptunus) is the Roman god of freshwater and the sea in Roman religion. He is the counterpart of the Greek god Poseidon. In the Greek inspired tradition, he is a brother of Jupiter and Pluto; the brothers preside over the realms of heaven, the earthly world (including the underworld), and the seas. Salacia is his wife. \n Depictions of Neptune in Roman mosaics, especially those in North Africa, were influenced by Hellenistic conventions. \n He was likely associated with freshwater springs before the sea. Like Poseidon, he was also worshipped by the Romans as a god of horses, as Neptunus equestris (a patron of horse racing).
