Saturn      \n Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun, and the second largest in the solar system. It's surrounded by beautiful rings. \n It takes 29 Earth years for Saturn to orbit the Sun. \n Having no surface, it might imply that this gas giant world could have a core. \n Saturn is considered the king of the moons equipped with 146 moons. A remarkable feature is its eight rings, which make for a spectacular system. \n  Its mean radius is equivalent to 9.13 Earths, its mass is 5.6846×10^26 kg (95.15 times as massive). As a result, its surface gravity (again, measured from the top of its clouds) is just slightly more than Earth's, which is 10.44 m\s^2. \n  Atmosphere composition: ~96% hydrogen (H2), ~3% helium, ~0.4% methane, ~0.01% ammonia, ~0.01% deuterated hydrogen (HD), 0.0007% ethane, ice: ammonia, water, ammonium hydrosulfite (NH4SH). \n   Mythology \n  Saturn (Latin: Saturnus) was a god in ancient Roman religion, and a character in Roman mythology. He was described as a god of time, generation, dissolution, abundance, wealth, agriculture, periodic renewal and liberation. \n Saturn's mythological reign was depicted as a Golden Age of abundance and peace. After the Roman conquest of Greece, he was conflated with the Greek Titan Cronus. \n Saturn's consort was his sister Ops, with whom he fathered Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto, Juno, Ceres and Vesta.
