Mars \n Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. \n The surface of Mars is orange-red because it is covered in iron (III) oxide dust, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet". \n Mars was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago. \n Mars is a terrestrial planet with a surface that consists of minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. \n Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, with a surface area only slightly less than Earth's dry land's total area. \n Of all the planets in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like, due to the similar tilts of the two planets' rotational axes. \n Mars has a gravitational force of 3.71 m/s^2. \n Atmosphere composition \n 95.72% carbon dioxide; 2.7% nitrogen; 1.6% argon; 0.2% oxygen; 0.07% carbon monoxide; 0.03% water vapor; 0.01% nitric oxide.
