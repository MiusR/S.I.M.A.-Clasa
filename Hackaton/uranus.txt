Uranus \n Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and the third largest planet in our solar system. It appears to spin sideways. \n Considered an Ice Giant, Uranus is about four times wider than Earth. \n It takes 84 Earth years to make a trip around the Sun. Uranus is mostly a mass of "icy" fluid around a rocky core. Uranus' 28 moons are named for characters in literature. \n Uranus is blue green in color due to large amounts of methane, which absorbs red light but allows blues to be reflected into space. \n The atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, but also includes large amounts of water, ammonia and methane. \n Its surface gravity (measured from its cloud tops) is slightly weaker than Earth's 8.69 m\s^2, or 0.886 g. \n Atmospheric composition (below 1.3 bar): 83% hydrogen (H2), 15% helium, 2.3% methane, 0.009% deuterated hydrogen (HD). Ice: ammonia, water, ammonium hydrosulphide (NH4SH), methane (CH4). \n Mythology \n In Greek mythology, Uranus, sometimes written Ouranos, is the personification of the sky and one of the Greek primordial deities. According to Hesiod, Uranus was the son and husband of Gaia (Earth), with whom he fathered the first generation of Titans. \n However, no cult addressed directly to Uranus survived into classical times and Uranus does not appear among the usual themes of Greek painted pottery. Elemental Earth, Sky, and Styx might be joined, however, in solemn invocation in Homeric epic. Uranus is associated with the Roman god Caelus.
